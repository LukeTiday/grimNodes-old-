# Contributing to GrimNodes

GrimNodes aims to simplify node-based procedural creation without complicating the user interface. If you enjoy working with Houdini, TouchDesigner, or Blender's geometry nodes, you'll feel right at home with us. Through grimNodes we are exploring how to maintain the core of proceduralism while remaining lightweight
